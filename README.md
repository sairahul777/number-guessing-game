# üéØ Number Guessing Game (Python)

Welcome to the **Number Guessing Game** ‚Äì a fun Python-based CLI game where the computer picks a number between 1 and 100, and your goal is to guess it with limited attempts depending on the difficulty level!


---

## üïπÔ∏è How It Works

- The program picks a random number between **1 and 100**.
- You choose a difficulty level:
  - üü¢ `easy` ‚Üí 10 attempts
  - üî¥ `hard` ‚Üí 5 attempts
- You keep guessing until:
  - You get the correct number, or
  - You run out of attempts.

The game tells you if your guess is **too high** or **too low** after each attempt.

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è How to Run
